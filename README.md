# Event-UHC
 A minecraft UHC with a random twist
<br>
<br>
The Event-UHC is a simple UHC where every X amount of time a random event start. These events can go from the harmless speed boost to dangerous one like tnt spawning or teleportation to other players. Some of them are really weird but I will let you discover them.
<br>
<br>
This game is not for players who want a serious game, it's not a fair game but it can be very fun.


## Setup
Install spigot or paper in 1.14 or +
<br>Download the plugin on the spigot page and put it in the plugins/ folder
<br>Op yourself, invite players
<br>use /eu config to configurate the game 
<br>use /eu start to start the game (you can set an auto start in the config.yml)
